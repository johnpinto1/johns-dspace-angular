    <a name="what">What is ROS</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    ROS (The Research Output Service) contains full-text copies of all
    Heriot-Watt University PhD theses awarded from 2009 onwards.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is mandatory for any student who completes a doctoral thesis to submit a
    digital copy for inclusion in ROS. In addition, the metadata-only records of
    older theses (previously held in the University Library catalogue) are
    included in ROS, with full text digital copies being sought on a voluntary
    basis. If you have a digital copy of your thesis and you wish to store it in
    ROS, please <a routerLink="/info/contact">contact us</a>.

  <h3>
    <a name="deposit">Depositing your doctoral thesis</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Where possible we have attempted to make use of pre-existing submissions
    processes. As previously, students will submit bound copies of their final
    thesis to Academic Registry, in addition to a CD ROM containing an
    electronic version of the final thesis in a PDF format. The digital version
    will be provided to the University Library for uploading into ROS. Where a
    student submits a request for limited access to their thesis, the full text
    of the eThesis will not be accessible, only the bibliographic record.
  </p>

    Format of Thesis' on the

  <h3>
    <a name="organised">How is ROS organised?</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Institutional Repository part of ROS is organised in a hierarchical
    framework where communities represent the top level of an archive
    collection. Communities correspond to Schools and Institutes, with an
    additional community for Research Pools and another for University Support
    Services. Research Pools is further divided into individual pools, and
    University Support Services into the different services. Under the
    communities are one or more collections - Doctoral Theses and Staff
    Publications - which contain the actual items.
  </p>
  <p>
    ROS is highly flexible in the way that items and authors can be displayed.
    For example, a single piece of work and its authors can be listed under a
    research pool and also the schools/institutes to which the authors are
    affiliated.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <a name="search">Searching ROS</a>
  </h3>
  <p>ROS provides flexible search capabilities. You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Browse (by title, author, or date).</li>
    <li>Perform general keyword searches.</li>
    <li>
      Perform more sophisticated searches on particular fields, using Boolean
      operators.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All of the above can be performed across the whole repository, within a
    particular community, or even within a specific collection
    (see '<a href="/info/about#organised">How is ROS organised?</a>').
